## 🔧 Production Deployment

### Requirements
```
Python 3.8+
websockets>=11.0
aiohttp>=3.8
aiosqlite>=0.17
mss>=6.1
Pillow>=9.0
psutil>=5.8
qrcode>=7.3
pywin32>=300 (Windows only)
```

### Installation
```bash
# Clone/download the application
cd focusclass_tkinter

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create required directories
mkdir logs exports assets

# Run setup check
python setup_check.py
```

### Network Configuration
- **Firewall**: Allow incoming connections on ports 8765-8770 and 8080-8085
- **Network**: Ensure all devices are on the same network
- **Antivirus**: Whitelist the application directory

### Production Tips
1. **Test Network**: Use `ping [teacher-ip]` to verify connectivity
2. **Administrator Rights**: Run as administrator for full focus mode features
3. **Multiple Sessions**: Each session gets unique ports automatically
4. **Backup**: Export session data regularly using the export feature

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```
❌ Problem: "Failed to connect to teacher"
✅ Solutions:
   1. Verify teacher IP address: ipconfig (Windows) / ifconfig (Linux)
   2. Check firewall settings - allow ports 8765-8770, 8080-8085
   3. Ensure both devices on same network
   4. Try different session - ports may be in use
```

### Performance Issues
```
❌ Problem: Slow screen sharing or high CPU
✅ Solutions:
   1. Close unnecessary applications
   2. Use wired network connection if possible
   3. Reduce screen resolution for better performance
   4. Check antivirus isn't scanning constantly
```

### Focus Mode Issues
```
❌ Problem: Restrictions not working properly
✅ Solutions:
   1. Run application as administrator
   2. Check Windows version compatibility
   3. Verify focus mode is enabled on teacher side
   4. Restart application if restrictions seem stuck
```
